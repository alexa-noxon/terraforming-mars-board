Pattern for making 2-layer laser cut player boards for the Terraforming Mars board game



# Description

This repository holds the design for a laser cut, 2-layer player board for the board game [Terraforming Mars](https://www.fryxgames.se/games/terraforming-mars/).    This design incorporates various features I've seen in other laser cut boards, and re-drawn art assets from the player mats included with the board game.

# Printing Instructions

I printed the above boards using my [GlowForge](https://glowforge.com/) laser printer.  Here are the steps I followed:

1. Print the bottom board on draftboard (I like the texture of it for holding pieces). I typically use either SD or draft engraving settings.
2. Print the top board on wood with a nice finish. I use the appropriate GlowForge automagic cutting settings.
3. Peel off the printing stickers (if using GlowForge proofgrade materials).
4. Apply wood glue to the underside of the top board.
5. Carefully align the boards and glue them together.
6. Allow the glue to set before using.
